On Change

I've been thinking about change a lot lately - whatching old ze frank videos thinking about being more poetic and lyrical.

Tight work friendships, and normal friendships. 

Staying awake with clenched jaws hoping the night would never end

The Diaspora of friendship and work colleagues.

The temple, all good things (star trek).
