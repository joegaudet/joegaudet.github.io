<p>
    A computer engineer by training, a software engineer by trade. If you looked up the definition of extrovert, you'd
    find a picture of me and an audio clip of my laugh.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked in a variety of roles and sectors, I cut my teeth in oil and gas, and have spent the balance of my
    career in
    SaaS of some form or another.
</p>
<p>
    I grew up a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG4ibI8M29q/">ski</a> racing and mountain biking, I love spending
    time outdoors (I try to walk a minimum of 10 KM every day). I also play <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJTfkwSOdPa/">hockey</a> and have recently taken up <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG1J2UfRleI/">boxing</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to becoming an engineer I had a brief stint as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtIqLvPZn_I">filmmaker</a>.
    These days my artistic side is mostly focused on cooking and learning to sing, but I also play a little guitar.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ§  Engineering Philosophy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I think best in objects &
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a>
        , with an eye towards <a
                href="https://hackernoon.com/10-oop-design-principles-every-programmer-should-know-f187436caf65"> design
            principles </a>
        and <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/ruby">patterns</a></li>
    <li>Design for simplicity, maintainability, and resilience.</li>
    <li>Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast</li>
    <li>Code is communication â€” write it clearly and with care.
        <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/kernighans-lever/index.php#:~:text=Brian%20Kernighan%20famously%20wrote%3A,will%20you%20ever%20debug%20it%3F">
            Don't be too clever if you can avoid it
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸ’¡What I Value</h2>
<h3>
    Curiosity
</h3>
<p>
    I've been called curious to a fault. I love learning, especially about people and professions I know nothing about.
    Working with me, know that I'm going to ask a lot of questions, and don't mind it if you do too!
</p>
<p>
    In my experience understanding the why of something lets us be more autonomous when we get into the nuts and bolts
    of
    the work.
</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>
    Sitting with headphones banging away on something is great, but nothing beats working through a hard problem or
    design at a whiteboard with colleagues. Solving truly large problems requires many people pulling in the same
    direction.
</p>
<p>
    I also love knowing more about my colleagues than what we work on, expect to get asked to skiing or for a walk or
    beers.
</p>
<h3>
    Integrity
</h3>
<p>
    Strive to have a Say-Do ratio as close to 1 as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Owning mistakes when they are made, avoiding blaming others.
</p>
<h3>
    Kindness
</h3>
<p>
    An absolute necessity for me in all my relationships. Reams have been written on this subject, being kind and nice
    are different,
    optimize for the former. Frameworks like radical candor are a good guide.
</p>

<h3>
    Craftsmanship
</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes we have to move fast, but to the extent possible we are spending our lives doing work, we should strive
    for that work to be the best it can be.
</p>
<p>
    I love the sentiment put forth in both the <a href="https://order-of-the-engineer.org/about-the-order/obligation/">the
    obligation of the engineer</a>, and the <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2012/05/07/apples-welcome-letter/">welcome
    letter from apple</a>.
</p>


<h2>ðŸ“š What I'm Learning right now</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Deeper understanding of TypeScript and related libraries</li>
    <li>OpenAI Realtime API and related apis (I built a chatbot for <a href="https://generation.film/">https://generation.film/</a>
    </li>
</ul>
